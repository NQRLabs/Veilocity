Random-Dot Kinematogram Technique:
The motion-defined text technique used in this software is based on
random-dot kinematograms (RDK), a classic psychophysics paradigm
developed in vision science research. The RDK technique itself is
in the public domain and has been widely used in perception research
since the 1960s.

  motion perception following lesions of the middle temporal visual
  area (MT)." Journal of Neuroscience.

The implementation in Veilocity is original and does not use any
existing RDK library code.
